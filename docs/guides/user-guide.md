## Location Management

### Creating Your First Location

**Note**: Only admin users can create locations. If you're a regular user, contact an administrator to set up locations.

For admin users, when you first use LibraryCard, you'll need to set up at least one location:

1. Click **"üè† Location Management"** tab
2. Click **"Create Your First Location"** button
3. Enter a **Location Name** (e.g., "Home", "Office", "Apartment")
4. Add an optional **Description**
5. Click **"Create Location"**

Each new location automatically gets a starter shelf called "my first shelf" that you can rename or organize as needed.

### Managing Locations

**Note**: Only admin users can manage locations. Regular users will only see existing locations without edit/delete buttons.

#### Adding More Locations (Admin Only)
1. In Location Management, click **"+ Add Location"**
2. Enter location name and description
3. Click **"Create Location"**

2. Click the **"Delete"** button
3. Confirm deletion (this will also delete all shelves in that location)

### Managing Shelves

**Note**: Only admin users can manage shelves. Regular users can view existing shelves but cannot create, edit, or delete them.

#### Adding Shelves (Admin Only)
1. Select a location by clicking on its card
2. In the "Shelves" section, click **"+ Add Shelf"**
3. Enter shelf name (e.g., "Fiction", "Cookbooks", "Reference")

### Organization Tips

#### Location Naming
- Use clear, descriptive names: "Home Library", "Office", "Beach House"
