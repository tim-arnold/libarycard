# OCR Feature Removal Specification

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: June 19, 2025  
**Status**: Approved  
**Priority**: High  

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the complete removal of the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) bookshelf scanning feature from LibraryCard. The decision is based on reliability issues, code complexity concerns, and the strategic focus on implementing more valuable multi-select book addition features.

## üéØ Rationale for Removal

### 1. Reliability Issues
- **Inconsistent accuracy**: OCR results vary significantly with lighting, camera angle, and book spine conditions
- **User frustration**: Unreliable features damage user trust and experience
- **False expectations**: Users expect OCR to work consistently, leading to disappointment
- **Error-prone workflow**: OCR failures require fallback to manual search anyway

### 2. Code Complexity vs. Value
- **High maintenance burden**: Google Vision API integration, image processing, error handling
- **Low adoption**: Feature is rarely used due to reliability issues
- **Development overhead**: OCR code complicates multi-select feature implementation
- **Technical debt**: Dormant OCR code still requires maintenance during refactoring

### 3. Strategic Focus
- **Multi-select enhancement**: Bulk book addition provides far more value
- **Simplified UX**: Two reliable methods (Search + ISBN) better than three unreliable ones
- **Resource allocation**: Development time better spent on high-impact features
- **User workflow clarity**: Clear, predictable book addition methods

### 4. Alternative Solutions
- **Manual search**: More reliable and often faster than OCR
- **Multi-select search**: Upcoming feature handles bulk addition use case better
- **ISBN scanning**: Reliable single-book addition method
- **Import features**: Future consideration for bulk book data import

```

### Dependencies
```
@google-cloud/vision                        (Large package)
tesseract.js                               (If not used elsewhere)
```

### State Management in AddBooks.tsx
```typescript
// OCR-related state variables
const [detectedTitles, setDetectedTitles] = useState<string[]>([])
const [bulkSearchResults, setBulkSearchResults] = useState<{}>({})
const [isBulkSearching, setIsBulkSearching] = useState(false)
const [preserveOcrResults, setPreserveOcrResults] = useState(false)
const [autoSearchAfterAdd, setAutoSearchAfterAdd] = useState(false)

// OCR-related handlers
const handleImageCaptured = () => { ... }
const handleTitlesDetected = async (titles: string[]) => { ... }
const performBulkSearch = async (titles: string[]) => { ... }
```

## üìã Removal Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Frontend Component Cleanup
**Objective**: Remove OCR UI components and related state management

#### Tasks:
1. **Remove BookshelfScanner Component**
   - Delete `src/components/BookshelfScanner.tsx`
   - Remove imports from AddBooks.tsx
   - Clean up TypeScript interfaces

2. **Clean AddBooks.tsx State**
   - Remove OCR-related state variables
   - Remove OCR event handlers
   - Remove bulk search results display
   - Clean up tab navigation logic

3. **Remove Google Vision API Library**
   - Delete `src/lib/googleVisionApi.ts`
   - Remove related TypeScript interfaces
   - Clean up any remaining imports

#### Files Modified:
- `src/components/AddBooks.tsx` (major cleanup)
- Remove: `src/components/BookshelfScanner.tsx`
- Remove: `src/lib/googleVisionApi.ts`

#### Lines Removed: ~400+ frontend lines

### Phase 2: Backend API Cleanup
**Objective**: Remove OCR endpoints and processing logic

#### Tasks:
1. **Remove Next.js OCR Route**
   - Delete `src/app/api/ocr-vision/route.ts`
   - Remove directory if empty

2. **Remove Cloudflare Worker OCR Module**
   - Delete `workers/ocr/index.ts`
   - Remove OCR imports from `workers/index.ts`
   - Clean up OCR routing logic

3. **Update Worker Configuration**
   - Remove OCR-related routes
   - Clean up imports and exports

#### Files Modified:
- `workers/index.ts` (remove OCR imports/routes)
- Remove: `src/app/api/ocr-vision/route.ts`
- Remove: `workers/ocr/index.ts`

#### Lines Removed: ~300+ backend lines

### Phase 3: Dependencies and Configuration
**Objective**: Remove unnecessary dependencies and configurations

#### Tasks:
1. **Package Dependencies**
   - Remove `@google-cloud/vision` from package.json
   - Audit `tesseract.js` usage (remove if OCR-only)
   - Run `npm audit` and cleanup

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Remove Google Vision environment variables from documentation
   - Clean up wrangler.toml if OCR-specific configs exist
