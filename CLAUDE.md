## Technical Architecture

### Authentication
- NextAuth.js with Google OAuth and credentials providers
- Workers API backend with password hashing using Web Crypto API
- Email verification system (simulated in development)
- Session management with conditional features based on auth provider

### Database Schema
- Users table supports multiple auth providers
- Books, locations, shelves with proper relationships
- Email verification tokens and expiration handling

### Development Environment
- Local development uses mock authentication for testing
- Workers API for production authentication and data storage
- Strong password validation on both frontend and backend

## Environment Setup Notes
- Development mode simulates email verification
- Users can test registration and immediate sign-in
- Production points to Cloudflare Workers API

## Recent Changes
- Added comprehensive email/password authentication
- Implemented strong password validation
- Created development mode testing workflow
- Fixed Suspense boundary issues with Next.js
- Enhanced sign-in UI with proper form states and error handling

### Session June 2025 Fixes
